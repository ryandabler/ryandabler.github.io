                <p>
                    I love solving problems and taking a deep dive into learning
                    new things, so when I had to learn advanced SQL concepts to
                    give a day-by-day running total of a company's inventory I
                    knew I had to be a programmer. Since becoming one, I have not
                    regretted that decision.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                    I do as much as I can with vanilla JavaScript because that
                    gives me the best understanding of how browsers, frameworks,
                    and the web work, although I happily work with frameworks to
                    renew my sense of wonder for what can be done in the language.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                    When I am not programming, I read literature and philosophy,
                    make sauerkraut, and walk around town.
